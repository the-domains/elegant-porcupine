            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey. Because his heart was beating irregularly, doctors suspected he had atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, which can increase the risk of stroke.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Y-3 Launches Y-3 Sport</h1><p>Though Y-3 is a beautiful collaboration between avant-garde Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto and global sportswear brand adidas, surprisingly, it's always been a fashion-first line. After 15 years, Yamamoto has thought it the proper time to go deep into Y-3's DNA and design its first-ever fully functional sport line.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/37ad461f62031730d604252b2e606f50cc4dbdcd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Assignment of a Lifetime: Riding in a U-2 Spy Plane at the Edge of Space</h1><p>Back in 2010, San Francisco-based photographer Christopher Michel received a once-in-a-lifetime photo assignment from the US Navel Institute: to ride in the back seat of a U-2 spy plane at the "edge of space." At the plane's cruising and intelligence-gathering altitude of 70,000 feet above the ground, temperatures outside the plane fall to 70 degrees below zero.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04f6c0633f5a485f90dde99e96cd653a67f86bd6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

For some of us, it makes for a viable alternative to coffee in the morning-with some serious sugar and cocoa kick.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/707cfeb12d925cddf6493a0f7a931b18979b2c86.jpg"></article>]]></description>
